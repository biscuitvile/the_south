# The South: The Gem

This charming yet useless gem injects Southern hospitality into any Ruby program.

I assure you I've lived there long enough to know.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'the_south'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install the_south

## Usage

```
South.rise_again
```

If you're adament:

```
South.rise_again!
```

When you're uncertain:

```
South.rise_again?
```

For a complete list of options use `South.singleton_methods`
